Getting bent out of shape for glass pane block's small hitbox?
This plugin turns glass panes into their full-block versions when one is holding a block to help align with them more easily!

If the players are too close to some glass panes that are supposed to be replaced,
a warning message will show on their screen so they will be less likely to get stuck or just fall off:

# 🔌 API
In spite of being a big spaghetti, this plugin still provides an API.
If you are developing an anticheat, please consider taking a look because this plugin sends fake blocks to clients:
```php
use Endermanbugzjfc\GlassPain\API as GlassPain;

$block = GlassPain::getInstance()->getClientSideBlock($player, $pos);
...
```
